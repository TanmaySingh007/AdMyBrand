# AdMyBrand - Modern SaaS Landing Page & Component System

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to AdMyBrand - my take on building a futuristic SaaS landing page with some seriously cool AI-powered features.

## What's This All About?

So I've been playing around with Next.js and wanted to create something that feels like it's from the future. This project combines modern web technologies with AI elements to create an immersive digital experience. Think Terminator meets modern web design, but way less scary! 😄

## Key Features

### 🎨 Theme System
- **Dark Mode**: Classic dark theme for those late-night coding sessions
- **Light Mode**: Clean and bright for daytime use
- **Night Vision**: Green-tinted overlay that makes you feel like you're in a sci-fi movie
- **Bright Mode**: Enhanced brightness and contrast for accessibility

### 🤖 AI Assistant
Built a chat interface that responds like a proper AI assistant. It's got that robotic voice thing going on - perfect for when you want to feel like you're talking to JARVIS from Iron Man.

### 🎭 Terminator Elements
- Robotic eye scanner (because why not?)
- Data overlay effects
- Target crosshair animations
- Voice synthesis with robotic tones

### 🎪 UI Components
- Glassmorphism cards with blur effects
- Smooth scroll animations
- 8K visual processing simulation
- Holographic displays
- Neural particle effects

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14** - Because it's just awesome
- **TypeScript** - For that sweet type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations
- **Zustand** - State management
- **Web Speech API** - For the robotic voice effects

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanmaySingh007/AdMyBrand.git
cd AdMyBrand
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install

## Theme System

The theme system is pretty flexible. You can switch between:
- **Dark**: Default dark theme
- **Light**: Clean light theme  
- **Night**: Green-tinted night vision mode
- **Bright**: Enhanced brightness mode
- **System**: Follows your OS preference

The themes affect the entire page including backgrounds, text colors, and even the AI voice interface.

## AI Features

### Voice Assistant
The AI assistant uses the Web Speech API to create a robotic voice effect. It's got a collection of responses that sound like they're coming from a sci-fi AI system.

### Terminator Interface
Added some fun Terminator-inspired elements:
- Scanning eye animation
- Data stream overlays
- Target acquisition crosshairs
- Robotic arm animations

## Customization

### Adding New Themes
You can add new themes by updating the `theme.ts` file and adding corresponding CSS variables in `globals.css`.

### Modifying AI Responses
The AI responses are stored in the `NavigationBar.jsx` component. You can easily add new response categories or modify existing ones.

### Styling Components
All components use Tailwind CSS classes and CSS custom properties for theming. The design system is built around the theme variables.

## Performance

- Optimized images with Next.js Image component
- Lazy loading for better performance
- Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- Efficient theme switching with CSS custom properties

## Browser Support

Works on all modern browsers that support:
- CSS custom properties
- Web Speech API
- ES6+ features
